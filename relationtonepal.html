        <h2 class="h">Me!:)</h2>
<p class="p"> I was born in the capitol city of Nepal, Kathmandu, in the hospital Thapathali. Kathmandu is a fantasic city. Me and my family own land in Itahari, and Kathmandu. I have visited one of Kathmandu's many temples. It is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashupatinath_Temple" target="blank">Pashupatinath Temple</a>. I love Nepal. 
    Kathmandu is wonderful.

    <h2 class="h">Relatives! :)</h2>
    <p class="p">I have many relatives in Nepal.
       Currently, I have two uncles and 2 aunts living in Kathmandu.
        I also have cousins in the city of Itahari. One of my cousins is Rosma Niraula. She is very nice. Rosma didi is the daughter of my father's older brother.
        All my relatives are great!
         I don't have many friends in Nepal though. 
        Many people think that Nepal is all poor and small. While that might be true, Nepal is rich is history, and huge in culture.
        Nepal is great.

<h2 class="h">Friends :)</h2>
<p class="p">
I don't really have any friends in Nepal. Nepal is full of good people, but I don't really get to know anyone. It doesn't matter, because the nature of Nepal is beautiful, and you forget everything when you take a deep breath of the natural air. Nepal is a great country, and I hope it stays that way.
</p>
<h1 class="hea">The End!</h1>
