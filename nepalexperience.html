<h1 class="hea">My Nepal Experience!</h1>
<hr>
<h2 class="h">Me in Nepal!</h2>
<div class="p">
<p>I have been to Nepal only twice in my life. One is when I used to live there and the other is when we went there to do a pooja after my grandmother passed away.
<h2 class="h">Taking the Plane to Nepal</h2>
The second time we went to Nepal, we took the plane flight, Emirates. It was a nice long flight that took a very long period of time. During the flight, I watched a movie and stayed in my comfy seat. It was a great flight.
<h2 class="h">Arrival</h2>
We arrived in the capital city, Kathmandu. There, we stayed in our uncle's house. Later, my tholobaba came to my uncle's house. I saw the famous Pashupatinath Temple. It was so huge! The temple was very nicely structured. There were very big pillars in the temple.
<h2 class="h">Travels</h2> After a week of staying in Kathmandu, My mother, sister, tholobaba, and I said farewell to my uncle and headed to Itahari.
 My father couldn't come because he had some work to do in Kathmandu.
  We arrived in Itahari in about a day.
   In Itahari I met one of my favorite cousins.
    In two days, my father joined us in Itahari.
     There my parents bought some land, and set up a shade to do the pooja.
      The pooja honored my late grandmother.
       The pooja lasted two days.
        After the pooja my family went to visit one of my father's brothers.
         I had some fun with another one of my cousins there.
          We didn't stay that much.
           After the visit, we went to my youngest aunt's house.
            There I met more of my cousins, who were great.
             After staying for three days we set off for my older aunt's house.
              There I met two of my other cousins.
               They too were great people.
                I found out that the younger cousin of the two was only younger than me by about two months.
                 After all that, it was finally time to go home. 
                 <h2 class="h">Coming back to America!</h2>After a month's visit to Nepal, we finally came back home to America.
                  We took the same airline, Emirates.
                   The flight felt quicker then before.
                    After a month's visit, we have stayed in America for 2 years.
                     I think that next year we will probably go back.
                      You never know!</p>
                      <h1 class="hea">The End!</h1>
