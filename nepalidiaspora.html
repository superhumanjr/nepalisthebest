<h2 class="he">The first Nepalese in America</h2>

<p class="p">The first official Nepalese visit to the United States took place late in 1939, during the homeward journey of Gen. Krishna Rana, Nepalâ€™s Minister in London. His successor, Gen. Shinga Rana, also visited the United States late in 1945. In the summer of 1946, a Nepalese mission, headed by Commanding General Baber Rana, spent several weeks in the United States as guests of the State and War Departments. General Baber Rana had fought valliantly in the first world war. They were in Washington from July 25 to August 1. Since they were guests of honor, they were treated very nicely. Unfortunatlly, he failed in his mission.</p>
<h2 class="he">The Current Nepalese </h2>
<p class="p"> More then two hundred thousand Nepalese live in US.The most amount of Nepalese live in Texas.In geograph distribution Katmandu, Nepal has the most number of Nepalese in the world. The least number of Nepalese is in the country, Iceland. Because of the harsh winter tempeture very few Nepalese live here. Here in the US, Nepalese barly are in the political area. In arts and jobs Nepalese can take alot of them. Some are eye specialists to cashiers. Although living in a whole bigger and more different country, Nepalese Americans haven't really changed. They all perserve and do their culture. It doesn't matter what kind of culture that is.</p>
